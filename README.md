What’s the purpose of this app?
 - The main purpose of FlingIn is connecting friends and giving them the opportunity to challenge each other in a fun way, the challenge is to visit/explore places around the world in a specific time frame! 

What does that mean?
 - ex. You’re traveling and suddenly you find out some beautiful/attractive place and you immediately wish some of your friends to see that same place too! 
  To make this happen you simply open FlingIn App on your Android smartphone and quickly send them a challenge which consists of your current location and the number of days to complete that challenge.
  Your friends would receive the challenge and in order to complete it they must go to the same place/location from where you’ve sent the challenge within the timeframe given  in days!
